Exercise 2.2:

A: The methods sortSeq and merge are the two methods that changes the order and rebuild the data.
B: If you have acces to multiple processors you can make another file and dump for example the merge function in there and run it on the other processor. 
	You then run the other program on another and BAM you have multiprocessing of sorts.
C: If the sorting tasks don't need each other to be sorted it can be run simultaneously.
